CyanogenMod Saga Device To-do List

Kernel
- Investigate qsd kernel errors
  "spi_qsd_new spi_qsd_new.0: SPI output underrun error"

- Investigate USB tethering. Unconfirmed.

- Work on porting the Saga source from HTC into the
  official cm-kernel. Currently we use Cayniarb's 
  Tiamat 1.4.0.1 kernel.

Proprietary Files
- Investigate why the shipped HTC Saga libaudio.so and
  libcamera.so fail to function with CM7. Currently using
  libaudio, libaudioalsa and libcamera from the HTC Vivo
  port by attn1.

  - libaudio.so results in no sound.
  - libcamera.so results in a freeze when loading the app
