CyanogenMod Saga Device To-do List

Kernel
- Investigate qsd kernel errors
  "spi_qsd_new spi_qsd_new.0: SPI output underrun error"

- Investigate USB tethering. Unconfirmed.

- Work on porting the Saga source from HTC into the
  official cm-kernel. Currently we use Cayniarb's 
  Tiamat 1.4.0.1 kernel.

Proprietary Files
- Investigate why the shipped HTC Saga libaudio.so and
  libcamera.so fail to function with CM7. Currently using
  libaudio, libaudioalsa and libcamera from the HTC Vivo
  port by attn1.

  - libaudio.so results in no sound.
  - libcamera.so results in a freeze when loading the app

Urgent Fixes
- Phone calls do not function. Other user cannot hear
  anything from the microphone and also hears a repeat
  of their speech with a delay of 1 second.

  - Not related to the RIL libraries.
    Tested libhtc_ril.so from known working AOSP ROM.

  - Seems to be aic3254 selecting the wrong tx mode
    29 instead of 15. Not hardware related as other
    AOSP ROM works correctly. DSP configuration?
