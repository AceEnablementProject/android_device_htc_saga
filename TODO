CyanogenMod Saga Device To-do List

- libaudio.so
  Initial testing shows the libaudio-msm7x30 source in
  the CyanogenMod tree functions as a replacement for the
  HTC proprietary libaudio.so. Further testing is required
  to see if all needed functions work as expected.

- libcamera.so
  The stock HTC Saga libcamera.so is from a Sense based
  ROM and, for reasons I yet do not understand, does not
  function correctly when running on an AOSP based ROM.
  The issue lies in userspace rather than the kernel as
  the libraries still fail to function running an AOSP
  userspace with the stock HTC kernel.

  Currently we're using the libcamera.so from an OTA update
  for the HTC Vision (Desire Z). This was released by
  T-Mobile USA which ship their version of the HTC Vision
  with an AOSP ROM not a Sense one. This device is known
  as the T-Mobile G2.

  The library functions correctly with our HTC Saga as
  both devices are based on the same MSM7x30 application
  processor, only running at different speeds.

  Using the stock Saga libcamera.so results in a freeze
  when swapping cameras, once the freeze has occured the
  camera cannot be accessed until a reboot has occurred.

- libhtc_ril.so
  Some Saga handsets exhibit a phone-call disconnection
  when the screen shuts off whilst using the stock Saga
  RIL. This has been traced to a function call in
  libhtc_ril.so, "ril_func_screen_state_notified()",
  trying to access a sysfs entry which does not exist on
  the AOSP kernel:

  /sys/devices/platform/msm_hsusb/usb_function_switch

  This results in a SEGFAULT in the rild process, causing
  the Android to loose the radio momentarily.

  It is currently unknown as to why this doesn't affect
  all Saga handsets but the solution is again to use the
  libhtc_ril.so from the T-Mobile G2 USA OTA update.

  This potentially causes issues with a ril vs radio
  firmware mismatch, but none have been reported so far.
